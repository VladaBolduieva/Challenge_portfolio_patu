# Task 1: software configuration
__Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?__

Hi. My name is Vlada. I decided to take part in the project because I want to find something to do that I like and enjoy. 
I think you should always learn something new and develop in different directions, so you can find something that you enjoy.
There are a lot of opportunities to enrich yourself and your knowledge, and become a better version of yourself every day.
I'm glad I found a program that can help me do that.

*Thank you for this opportunity!*
